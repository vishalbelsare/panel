Panelite is a [JupyterLite distribution](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that includes extensions allowing Panel to work as if we were running a real Python server.

If you want to set up your own JupyterLite with support for Panel [visit the user guide](https://panel.holoviz.org/panel/user_guide/Running_in_Webassembly.html#Setting-up-JupyterLite).
