# Server Configuration

The Panel server can be launched either from the commandline (using `panel serve`) or programmatically (using `panel.serve()`). In this guide we will discover how to run and configure server instances using these two options.

## Launching a server on the commandline

Once the app is ready for deployment it can be served using the Bokeh server.  For a detailed breakdown of the design and functionality of Bokeh server, see the [Bokeh documentation](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html). The most important thing to know is that Panel (and Bokeh) provide a CLI command to serve a Python script, app directory, or Jupyter notebook containing a Bokeh or Panel app. To launch a server using the CLI, simply run:

    panel serve app.ipynb

Alternatively you can also list multiple apps:

    panel serve app1.py app2.ipynb

or even serve a number of apps at once:

    panel serve apps/*.py

For development it can be particularly helpful to use the ``--autoreload`` option to `panel serve` as that will automatically reload the page whenever the application code or any of its imports change.

The ``panel serve`` command has the following options:

    positional arguments:
      DIRECTORY-OR-SCRIPT   The app directories or scripts or notebooks to serve
                            (serve empty document if not specified)

To turn a notebook into a deployable app simply append ``.servable()`` to one or more Panel objects, which will add the app to Bokeh's ``curdoc``, ensuring it can be discovered by Bokeh server on deployment. In this way it is trivial to build dashboards that can be used interactively in a notebook and then seamlessly deployed on Bokeh server.

When called on a notebook, `panel serve` first converts it to a python script using [`nbconvert.PythonExporter()`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/exporters.html), albeit with [IPython magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) stripped out. This means that non-code cells, such as raw cells, are entirely handled by `nbconvert` and [may modify the served app](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/raw-cells.html).

## Launching a server dynamically

The CLI `panel serve` command described below is usually the best approach for deploying applications. However when working on the REPL or embedding a Panel/Bokeh server in another application it is sometimes useful to dynamically launch a server, either using the `.show` method or using the `pn.serve` function.

### Previewing an application

Working from the command line will not automatically display rich representations inline as in a notebook, but you can still interact with your Panel components if you start a Bokeh server instance and open a separate browser window using the ``show`` method. The method has the following arguments:

    port: int (optional)
       Allows specifying a specific port (default=0 chooses an arbitrary open port)
    websocket_origin: str or list(str) (optional)
       A list of hosts that can connect to the websocket.
       This is typically required when embedding a server app in
       an external-facing web site.
       If None, "localhost" is used.
    threaded: boolean (optional, default=False)
       Whether to launch the Server on a separate thread, allowing
       interactive use.
    title : str
       A string title to give the Document (if served as an app)
    **kwargs : dict
       Additional keyword arguments passed to the bokeh.server.server.Server instance.

To work with an app completely interactively you can set ``threaded=True`` which will launch the server on a separate thread and let you interactively play with the app.

<img src='https://assets.holoviews.org/panel/gifs/commandline_show.gif'></img>

The ``.show`` call will return either a Bokeh server instance (if ``threaded=False``) or a ``StoppableThread`` instance (if ``threaded=True``) which both provide a ``stop`` method to stop the server instance.

### Serving multiple apps

If you want to serve more than one app on a single server you can use the ``pn.serve`` function. By supplying a dictionary where the keys represent the URL slugs and the values must be either Panel objects or functions returning Panel objects you can easily launch a server with a number of apps, e.g.:

```python
import panel as pn
pn.serve({
    'markdown': '# This is a Panel app',
    'json': pn.pane.JSON({'abc': 123})
})
```

Note that when you serve an object directly all sessions will share the same state, i.e. the parameters of all components will be synced across sessions such that the change in a widget by one user will affect all other users. Therefore you will usually want to wrap your app in a function, ensuring that each user gets a new instance of the application:

```python

def markdown_app():
    return '# This is a Panel app'

def json_app():
    return pn.pane.JSON({'abc': 123})

pn.serve({
    'markdown': markdown_app,
    'json': json_app
})
```

You can customize the HTML title of each application by supplying a dictionary where the keys represent the URL slugs and the values represent the titles, e.g.:

```python
pn.serve({
    'markdown': '# This is a Panel app',
    'json': pn.pane.JSON({'abc': 123})
}, title={'markdown': 'A Markdown App', 'json': 'A JSON App'}
)
```

The ``pn.serve`` accepts a number of arguments:

    panel: Viewable, function or {str: Viewable or function}
      A Panel object, a function returning a Panel object or a
      dictionary mapping from the URL slug to either.
    port: int (optional, default=0)
      Allows specifying a specific port
    address: str
      The address the server should listen on for HTTP requests.
    websocket_origin: str or list(str) (optional)
      A list of hosts that can connect to the websocket.

      This is typically required when embedding a server app in
      an external web site.

      If None, "localhost" is used.
    loop: tornado.ioloop.IOLoop (optional, default=IOLoop.current())
      The tornado IOLoop to run the Server on
    show: boolean (optional, default=False)
      Whether to open the server in a new browser tab on start
    start: boolean(optional, default=False)
      Whether to start the Server
    title: str or {str: str} (optional, default=None)
      An HTML title for the application or a dictionary mapping
      from the URL slug to a customized title
    verbose: boolean (optional, default=True)
      Whether to print the address and port
    location: boolean or panel.io.location.Location
      Whether to create a Location component to observe and
      set the URL location.
    kwargs: dict
      Additional keyword arguments to pass to Server instance

## Static file hosting

Whether you're launching your application using `panel serve` from the commandline or using `pn.serve` in a script you can also serve static files. When using `panel serve` you can use the `--static-dirs` argument to specify a list of static directories to serve along with their routes, e.g.:

    panel serve some_script.py --static-dirs assets=./assets

This will serve the `./assets` directory on the servers `/assets` route. Note however that the `/static` route is reserved internally by Panel.

Similarly when using `pn.serve` or `panel_obj.show` the static routes may be defined as a dictionary, e.g. the equivalent to the example would be:

    pn.serve(panel_obj, static_dirs={'assets': './assets'})
