# Testing

This chapter describes how to run various tests locally in a development environment, guidelines for writing tests, and information regarding the continuous testing infrastructure.

## Running Tests Locally

Before attempting to run Panel tests, make sure you have successfully run through all of the instructions in the [developer setup guide](index.md).

### pre-commit

Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to ensure that your code is linted correctly whenever you commit a change.

To run the `pre-commit` hooks explicitly:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

### Test Selection

Currently Panel uses linting and three types of tests:

* *Unit tests*: usually small tests executed with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org), they can be found in `panel/tests/`.
* *UI tests*: Panel provides web components that users can interact with through their browser, UI tests allow to check that these components get displayed as expected, and that the backend <-> front-end bi-communication (e.g. updating a widget value in the front end should update its value in Python) works correctly. UI tests are possible thanks to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/), they can be found in the `panel/tests/ui/` folder.
* *Notebooks smoke tests*: Panel's documentation consists mostly of Jupyter Notebooks, these smoke tests execute all the notebooks and fail if an error is raised during their execution. Notebook smoke tests are possible thanks to [nbval](https://nbval.readthedocs.io/) and can be found in the `examples/` folder.


To run flake checking explicitly run:

```bash
doit test_flakes
```

To run unit tests use:

```bash
doit test_unit
```

To run UI tests use:

```bash
doit test_ui
```

To run example smoke tests use:

```
doit test_examples
```

## Writing Tests

In order to help keep Panel maintainable, all Pull Requests that touch code should normally be accompanied by relevant tests. While exceptions may be made for specific circumstances, the default assumption should be that a Pull Request without tests may not be merged.

### Python Unit Tests

Python unit tests maintain the basic functionality of the Python portion of the Panel library. A few general guidelines will help you write Python unit tests:

- absolute imports

    In order to ensure that Panel's unit tests as relocatable and unambiguous as possible, always prefer absolute imports in test files. When convenient, import and use the entire module under test:

    * **GOOD**: ``import panel.widgets``
    * **GOOD**: ``from panel.layout import Column``
    * **BAD**: ``from ..models.widgets import Player``

- pytest

    All new tests should use and assume [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for test running, fixtures, parameterized testing, etc. New tests should *not* use the `unittest` module of the Python standard library.

### UI tests

It may be difficult to write UI tests robust enough to pass all the time. For instance some tests may need to download some CSS resources online, if the domain that hosts these resources do not serve them in a limited time (defined by a Playwright timeout) then the test will fail. To cover these cases you can mark your test as flaky with `@pytest.mark.flaky`, refer to [flaky](https://github.com/box/flaky)'s documentation for more information.

## Continuous Integration

Every push to the `master` branch or any Pull Request branch on GitHub automatically triggers a full test build on the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) continuous integration service. This is most often useful for running the full Panel test suite continuously, but also triggers automated scripts for publishing releases when a tagged branch is pushed.

You can see the list of all current and previous builds at this URL: https://github.com/holoviz/panel/actions

### Configuration

There are a number of files that affect the build configuration:

* `.github/worksflows/test.yaml`

    Defines the build matrix and global configurations for the stages
    described below.

* `conda.recipe/meta.yaml`

    Instructions for building a conda noarch package for Panel.

* `setup.py`

    Used to build sdist packages and "dev" installs. This file is the **single source of truth of all dependencies**.

* `tox.ini`

    Contains the configuration for the doit commands .

### Etiquette

GitHub Actions provides free build workers to Open Source projects. A few considerations will help you be considerate of others needing these limited resources:

* Run the tests locally before opening a Pull Request, or before committing to an opened Pull Request.

* Group commits into meaningful chunks of work before pushing to GitHub (i.e. don't push on every commit).

* If you must make multiple commits in succession, navigate to GitHub Actions and cancel all but the last build, in order to free up build workers.
